# Additional datasets
# Include: https://www.nber.org/research/data/nber-ces-manufacturing-industry-database
# Consider: https://wayback.archive-it.org/5902/20181003221605/https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/iris/

# What we can do with this data
# characteristics of high-patent industries (what are the incentives)
# see how r&d dollar per firm affects investment/desire of people to be entrepreneurs 
# r&d and startup survival rate
# are people more encouraged to be entrepreneurs in industries with greater r&d spending
# how about industries where there are lots of patents? 
# are rewards up front greater than delayed gratification? 
# does greater r&d/new entrepreneurship in an industry increase likelihood patent will be cited?
# might need to do some background about patent citations -- this could be the lit review for proposal
# example: https://www.law.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/clbe/events/innovation/documents/AbramsSampatDrugCites060917.pdf

# as subsidies increase, innovation decreases 
# (so potentially as those go up in an industry, which would only happen in more concentrated industries,
# innovation/patents might fall OR patents per researcher)

# For next week
# look through codebooks and find variables you want to explore
